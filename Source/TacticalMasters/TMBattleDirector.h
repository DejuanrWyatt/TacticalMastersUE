// Puts the ported rules on screen.
//
// The rules live in TMSim and know nothing about Unreal -- no actors, no
// meshes, no world. This is the piece in the middle: it owns a battle, steps
// its clock, and keeps one visible unit in the level for each unit in the
// simulation. Nothing here decides anything about the game; it reads what the
// simulation says and shows it.
//
// The controls are CallInEditor so a battle can be built and stepped without
// entering Play, which is how it is checked from outside the editor.
